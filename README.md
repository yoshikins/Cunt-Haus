# Willkommen im die Cunt-Haus

## Guide
- Download [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/download/).
- Using [Curseforge](https://www.curseforge.com/download/app) or any other mod manager, create a minecraft instance with these specs:
  - Minecraft Version 1.20.1
  - Forge Version 47.3.0
- Using Github Desktop, clone [this repo](https://github.com/yoshikins/CuntenHausen) into the same directory as the new minecraft instance.
  - Be sure that it doesn't create a sub-folder in the instance directory, and instead shares it.
  - It should look like this:

Note: you may have to move the files manually to the root directory to match this ^. If you have to do that, then just be sure re-locate the directory from within Github Desktop.

## Usage
- If there are any mod pack changes to the client, we will upload them here.
- You can pull the changes from Github using a single button and all files should update automatically.

- Only files in the /mods directory are managed with Github, so no worries about settings or local configs getting erased.
