# Willkommen im die Cunt-Haus

## Guide
- Download [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/download) and log in or make an account if you do not have one already.
- Using [Curseforge](https://www.curseforge.com/download/app) or any other mod manager, create a minecraft instance with these specs:
  - Minecraft Version `1.20.1`
  - Forge Version `47.3.0`
- Using Github Desktop, clone this repository into a temporary directory on your device using the repository URL.
- It may take a moment to do so, as you're essentially downloading an uncompressed version of the modpack to your device.
- When it's done cloning, make sure that you have hidden files visible in your file explorer, and move (not copy) all of the contents in the temporary directory to the Minecraft directory that your mod manager created.
- It should look like this:

![This is what it should look like](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2f18ce57-fe8e-4f50-8bc1-e82656762a4f)

- Return to GitHub desktop and it should show a message saying that it can no longer find the files.
- Hit `Locate` and navigate to the Minecraft instance folder that you moved the files to and hit `Select Folder`
- You should be now ready to play on the server and easily update to any new modpack versions.

## Usage
- If there are any mod pack changes to the client, we will upload them here.
- You can pull the changes from Github Desktop using a single button and all files should update automatically.

- Only files in the /mods directory are managed with Github, so no worries about settings or local configs getting erased when you update the modpack. Directories that also are not managed are shaders and resourcepacks, so feel free to use any that you enjoy the most.
- You are allowed to have any client side mods you wish on the server so long as you are able to actually join and play with no conflicts.

## Disclaimer 
The modpack is not in its final state as there's a lot of kinks that we want to get rid of with like world generation, performance, etc. If you notice any quirks on your client or any odd interactions between mods please use GitHub to file a bug report in the repo, attach your crash report, and pray we can fix it on our end or help you fix it on yours. 

If you have any suggestions for mods to add in the future, please leave a bug report here as well with your suggestions.
