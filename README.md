## Github Desktop
If you have Github Desktop just clone the repo and put the .git in your curseforge minecraft instance directory.
Then you can just pull from the repo whenever there are any changes.
The .gitignore file excludes everything that isn't a mod, resource pack, or shader pack.

## Browser Download
If you don't have github desktop then download the repo and replace the mods, resourcepacks, and shaperpacks directories in your curseforge minecraft instance directory with the ones you've downloaded here.
